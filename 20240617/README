Global Biotic Interactions: Taxon Graph Patch 20240617-01

2024-06-17

Abstract / Introduction 

As noted by https://github.com/kbseah in https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/968 - 


"[...] I found an unusual error when the taxon Candidatus Endoriftia persephone is used in a query (adding a screenshot in case this the problem is specific to my browser):
https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/?interactionType=interactsWith&targetTaxon=Candidatus%20Endoriftia%20persephone

[...] 

Under the taxon name, instead of a single link per external database as expected, there are multiple links. What they all have in common is that the names start with Candidatus. This is a designation used only in prokaryotic nomenclature for provisional names of taxa that are not yet in culture, because the prokaryotic code requires a type culture for valid publication (details).

Perhaps Candidatus names are being misinterpreted as Linnean trinomials by the name matcher?

Surprisingly there was no Wikidata item for Candidatus Endoriftia persephone, but I've just created one: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124846046
"

Proposed fix is to remove all Candidatus mappings and allow for future versions of the GloBI Taxon Graph to re-introduce mappings using an updated name matching algorithm.

Methods

A script "create_patch.sh" was constructed to remove name mappings mentioning "Candidatus".


To apply the patch, run the "patch" program against the original
taxonMap file with the .patch files on any linux-y system.

Patch files taxonMap.tsv.patch.gz was 
created using: create_patch.sh in period 2024-06-17 .

Result/Discussion 

The resulting patch removed incorrect mapping involving "Candidatus".
