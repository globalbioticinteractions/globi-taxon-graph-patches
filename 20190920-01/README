Global Biotic Interactions: Taxon Graph Patch 20190920-01 

2019-09-20 

Abstract / Introduction 

This is a improved version of patch 20190816-01 [1], fixing a minor bug that prevented patching of multiple EOL_V2 ids in the taxonCache file. The patch was generated from GloBI Taxon Graph v0.3.15 [2] and the most recent EOL Dynamic Hierarchy Active Version [3]. 

Methods

Repeating a improved script used in patch 20190816-01 [1], 
to prevent pointing to no longer present EOL web pages from GloBI, 
an automated precedure was implemented to do the following: for each of 
the page ids referenced in the current active version of the EOL 
Dynamic Taxon Hierarchy, make sure that the GloBI Taxon Graph maps to 
EOL page id with prefix "EOL:". For EOL pages ids that do *not* appear
in the EOL Dynamic Taxon Hierarchy, ensure that that GloBI Taxon Graph maps
to EOL page id with prefix "EOL_V2:". 

To apply the patch, run the "patch" program against the original
taxonCache/taxonMap files with the .patch files on any linux-y system.

Patch files taxonMap.tsv.patch.gz and taxonCache.tsv.patch.gz were 
created using: create_patch.sh in period 2019-09-20/2019-09-22 .

Result/Discussion 

The resulting improved patch re-mapped previously assumed deprecated links
back to active EOL page ids. Also, assumed active pages were labeled
as deprecated by prefixing them with EOL_V2: .
