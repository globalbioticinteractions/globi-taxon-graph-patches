Global Biotic Interactions: Taxon Graph Patch 20190816-01 
2019-08-16 

Abstract / Introduction 

Following release of Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) v3 in
November 2018, an unspecified collection of EOL page ids (aka taxon concept ids)
were deprecated and no longer supported. This issue was
documented in https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/383 and a patch
was published [1]. This patch revisits the deprecated EOL page ids using 
observations documented in https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/403
, a newly published EOL Dynamic Taxon Hierarchy [2] and a recent GloBI Taxon Graph
version [3]. 

Methods

To prevent pointing to no longer present EOL web pages from GloBI, 
an automated precedure was implemented to do the following: for each of 
the page ids referenced in the current active version of the EOL 
Dynamic Taxon Hierarchy, make sure that the GloBI Taxon Graph maps to 
EOL page id with prefix "EOL:". For EOL pages ids that do *not* appear
in the EOL Dynamic Taxon Hierarchy, ensure that that GloBI Taxon Graph maps
to EOL page id with prefix "EOL_V2:". 

To apply the patch, run the "patch" program against the original
taxonCache/taxonMap files with the .patch files on any linux-y system.

Patch files taxonMap.tsv.patch.gz and taxonCache.tsv.patch.gz were 
created using: create_patch.sh in period 2019-08-16/2019-08-19 .

Result/Discussion 

The resulting patch re-mapped 19,369 previously assumed deprecated links
back to active EOL page ids. Also, 15,418 assumed active pages were labeled
as deprecated by prefixing them with EOL_V2: . Anectodal evidence [4] suggests
that the EOL Dynamic Taxon Hierarchy does not include all active pages. This is
why re-running the GloBI Taxon Graph against future version of the EOL Dynamic
Taxon Hierarchy are expected.
