Global Biotic Interactions: Taxon Graph Patch 20210114-01 

2021-01-14 

Abstract / Introduction 

Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) uses Nomer [1] to resolve taxonomic names to known taxonomic name resources. One of these taxonomic name services is http://resolver.globalnames.org . Over the years, various issues [3, 4,5,6] have been reported that related to NCBI taxon name linking functionality. In a recent version of Nomer [2], various workaround have been implement to help reduce the unexpected NCBI linkages reported by http://resolver.globalnames.org.


Methods

Nomer v0.1.19 [1] is used in provided create_patch.sh script to 
link names of taxonMap.tsv.gz in GloBI Taxon Graph v0.3.27 [2] to
re-resolve the NCBI taxon links and replace the previously resolved
links. 

To apply the patch, run the "patch" program against the original
taxonCache/taxonMap files with the .patch files on any linux-y system.

Patch files taxonMap.tsv.patch.gz and taxonCache.tsv.patch.gz were 
created using: create_patch.sh in period 2021-01-14/2021-01-15 .

Result/Discussion 

The resulting patch updates existing NCBI taxon links in GloBI Taxon Graph v0.3.27 .
